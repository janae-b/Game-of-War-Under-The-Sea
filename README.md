# Under the Sea War

## Instructions
* There are two players each with their own deck of 26 cards (a full deck split in half)
* Each person draws a card from their deck and reveal the face value.
* Whoever has the higher card value wins that round (Aces being the highest score)
* If there is a tie, the players face off in a "war."  They each pull another card from the top of their deck and see which card is of higher value.  Whoever has the higher value wins all four cards that round.
* Bonus in my game: if you feel that the game is dragging a bit, you can hit the "Bored?" button and whoever is in the lead with their score wins the game!

Here is the game!

## Why I chose it:
Growing up, my family would take a lot of two week vacations across the country in our van.  That meant a lot of freetime for my sister and me and we would try to find ways to pass the time in the van.  One of the games that was easier to play in the van was war.  War can also take a bit of time to play so it was also a good time waster when sitting in the car for hours on end. I’ve also always liked the simplicity of War and that it is easy to teach to others.

When you click draw, the first card will flip from each deck and these two cards will compete.

![First Draw](FirstCard.png)
The winner is whoever has a higher card value.  

![War](War.png)
If the two cards drawn are tied, then each player draws another card from the top of their deck.  Whoever has the higher value card from that wins all four cards.
